      <p>Hi! My name is Ramish, and I am currently taking WDD 130: Web Fundamentals. I have always been interested in web design and development, and Iâ€™m excited to learn how to create and style websites.

        A little about me I enjoy reading, gaming, hiking, coding, and I love exploring new ways to be creative. My goal is to develop my web development skills and build projects that are both functional and visually appealing.
        
        I look forward to learning more throughout this course and applying my knowledge to real-world projects!</p>
